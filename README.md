# 🎤 Audio-Based Interviewer (Frontend)

This is the **frontend-only** implementation of an audio-based interviewer web application. The app simulates a job interview by asking questions using Text-to-Speech, records audio responses, transcribes them using Speech-to-Text, and generates a report with both audio and transcripted answers.

- **React Router** for navigation
- **Web APIs**:
  - `speechSynthesis` for TTS
  - `webkitSpeechRecognition` for STT
- **CSS Modules** for styling
- **Jest** + **React Testing Library** for unit & integration tests

## ⚙️ CI - GitHub Actions

A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/frontend-ci.yml`) runs on every push or pull request to `main`:

* Lints and builds the app
* Installs dependencies
* Runs all tests
